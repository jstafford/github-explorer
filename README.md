Real World React Redux With Infinite Scroll
===========================================

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It is based on the "real world" example from Redux, found in the
examples/real-world directory of [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)

It is described as follows:

This is the most advanced example. It is dense by design. It covers keeping
fetched entities in a normalized cache, implementing a custom middleware for
API calls, rendering partially loaded data, pagination, caching responses,
displaying error messages, and routing. Additionally, it includes Redux
DevTools.

It is updated to the latest versions, slightly modified to keep a fixed header
(rather than scroll the entire window), and extended with the
[Redux infinite scroll](https://github.com/RealScout/redux-infinite-scroll)
module by RealScout.

For a guide on how to perform find some common tasks specific to apps built
with Create React App, see the [react-scripts README](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
