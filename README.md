===============

This is examples/real-world from [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
combined with
redux-infinite-scroll(https://github.com/RealScout/redux-infinite-scroll),
deployed as a GitHub pages app. You can play with it
[here](https://jstafford.github.io/github-explorer/).

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The "real-world" example is described as follows in the React docs:

> This is the most advanced example. It is dense by design. It covers keeping
> fetched entities in a normalized cache, implementing a custom middleware for
> API calls, rendering partially loaded data, pagination, caching responses,
> displaying error messages, and routing. Additionally, it includes Redux
> DevTools.

The example is updated to the latest versions, minimally modified to pass the desired
api version, and extended with the
[Redux infinite scroll](https://github.com/RealScout/redux-infinite-scroll)
module by RealScout.

For a guide on how to perform find some common tasks specific to apps built
with Create React App, see the [react-scripts README](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
